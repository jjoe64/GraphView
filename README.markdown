Chart and Graph Library for Android
====================================

<h2>What is this project?</h2>
This is an extension on <a href="https://github.com/jjoe64/GraphView">jjoe64's GraphView</a> (specifically the 3.1.3 version distributed on Gradle) that adds two new classes: AnimatedBarGraphView and LineBarGraph.

These new classes allow the user to have their graphs animated when shown.
